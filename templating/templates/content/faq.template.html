        <h5>What is ArtSimily?</h5>
        <p>
          ArtSimily is a platform where you can rate the similarity of various pieces of digital art.
        </p>

        <h5>What do I do?</h5>
        <p>
          When you click on the play button, ArtSimily will show you pairs of art pieces which you can rate on a four
          point scale. After some questions, you will get a score telling you how well you did.
        </p>

        <h5>How is the score generated?</h5>
        <p>
          ArtSimily compares some of your answers to the answers of other players who were shown the same questions.
          The higher the agreement, the higher your score.
        </p>

        <h5>What do you mean by ‘similarity’?</h5>
        <p>
          We don’t have a clear definition, so it can mean whatever the majority of players think it means.
        </p>

        <h5>Where does the art come from?</h5>
        <p>
          When you hover over a piece, a text-box should appear which shows the source of this particular piece. All
          pieces were released under a creative commons license by their creators.
        </p>

        <h5>I had a piece without a source text-box, why is that?</h5>
        <p>
            A few of the pieces don’t show the attribution correctly. This is a bug and we are working on fixing it.
        </p>

        <h5>Why do you need to know the similarity of these things?</h5>
        <p>
          ArtSimily is a research project, trying to establish a basis dataset in order to improve the quality of
          results generated by multimedia search engines.
        </p>

        <h5>Who is behind ArtSimily?</h5>
        <p>
          ArtSimily is a project of the Databases and Information Systems Research Group at the University of Basel in
          Switzerland.
